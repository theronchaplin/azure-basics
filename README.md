<h1>Microsoft Azure Basics</h1>
The lab introduces the basics of Microsoft Azure, focusing on creating and managing resources within the Azure platform. I learn how to set up a subscription, explore Azure's portal, create and organize resources (such as resource groups and storage accounts), upload and manage data, and clean up resources to avoid unnecessary costs. This hands-on experience aims to build foundational knowledge of Azure's capabilities for hosting, managing, and storing data.<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Resource Groups, Storage Groups)
- Text File


<h2>Step-by-Step</h2>

1. Set Up Azure
  - Create a free Azure subscription or use the "Pay As You Go" option.
  - Log in to the Azure Portal at Azure Portal.

&nbsp;

2. Explore the Portal
  - Familiarize yourself with features like Resource Groups, Virtual Machines, and EntraID.

&nbsp;

3. Create a Resource Group
  - Use the portal to create a new Resource Group, which acts as a container for related Azure resources.

&nbsp;

4. Create a Storage Account
  - Within the Resource Group, create a Storage Account. This is used to securely store data objects like files or blobs.

&nbsp;

5. Create and Upload a File
  - Create a plain text file on your local machine (ensure it's set to plain text).

  - Upload the file to the Azure Storage Account.

  - To organize your data, create a container within the Storage Account before uploading the file.

6. Modify the File
  - Edit the file directly in the Azure portal.

  - Download the edited file to your local machine and verify the changes.

&nbsp;

7. Clean Up Resources
  - Delete the Resource Group to prevent unnecessary costs.

  - Verify the deletion to ensure no resources remain active.
